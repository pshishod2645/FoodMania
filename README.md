# FoodMania
**FoodMania** is a **web-app** which is part of our project in Software Engineering Lab under Dr. Debasis Samanta.

## Prerequisite/libraries used
1. Python3 needs to be installed, if it is not, you can simply google how to do it(it's fairly easy).
2. Django needs to be installed, if it is not, open terminal and type `pip3 install Django`.

## Usage(Tested on ubuntu 18.04)
1. Clone or Fetch this repo to your local machine.
2. To start the server go to the repo directory in terminal and type `python3 manage.py runserver`. Note:Keep this running as long as you are using the website.
3. Now open browser and visit `127.0.0.1:8000/`(or something similar that appeared on terminal when previous command was run). This is the home-page of this web-site.(locally).
4. Navigate like a normal web-site.
5. If you want to see database/user info, you can add your own super-user by running `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` in the repo's directory.
